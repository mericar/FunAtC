# FunAtC
C/C++ repo: Algs, concepts, etc.

Some might vomit at the prospect of tossing C and C++ into a conceptual repo such as this one,
I suggest the destiny of the two are bound, and the utility in comparing and contrasting 
the two languages is helpful in better understanding the limits and use cases for procedural 
and object-oriented programming.
