# FunAtC
C/C++ repo: Algs, concepts, etc.

Some might vomit at the prospect of tossing C and C++ in a conceptual repo such as this,
however the destiny of the two are bound, and the utility in comparing and contrasting 
the two languages is helpful in better understanding the bounds and use cases for procedural 
and object-oriented programming.
